1. Identify the simplest possible behavior the program must exhibit.
2. Write a coded test for this behavior.
3. Before coding, confirm the test fails.
4. Implement the behavior with the least amount of code possible.
5. Run the automated test to confirm it passes. If it doesn't, revisit step 4.
6. Confirm all previous tests still pass. If it doesn't, revisit step 4.
7. Check if code can be refactored. If so, refactor and repeat step 6.
8. Repeat this process with the next simplest behavior.
